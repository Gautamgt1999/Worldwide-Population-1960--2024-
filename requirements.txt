📋 Project Requirements Specification
1. Functional Requirements
Data Ingestion: The system must be capable of reading large-scale historical population data from CSV formats (e.g., World Bank datasets with 16,000+ rows).

Preprocessing & Cleaning: * The system must identify and handle missing values in critical fields (iso3, population).

Data must be validated for type consistency (Years as Integers, Population as Floats).

Database Persistence: * The system must establish a secure connection to a PostgreSQL server using SQLAlchemy.

The system must automate the creation of a table named population_data.

The upload process must support if_exists="replace" to allow for data refreshes without manual table deletion.

Data Retrieval: Users must be able to verify the data migration by executing SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, COUNT) directly through the Python interface.

2. Technical Requirements (The Tech Stack)
Programming Language: Python 3.12 or higher.

Data Manipulation: pandas for DataFrame operations.

Database Driver: psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL communication.

ORM/SQL Toolkit: SQLAlchemy (v2.0 preferred) for managing database engines and sessions.

Database Server: PostgreSQL 15 or higher (local or cloud-hosted).

Visualization (Optional): matplotlib or seaborn for trend analysis.

3. Data Requirements (Input File Specifications)
The input file (WB_population_cleaned.csv) must contain the following schema:
| Field | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| iso3 | Non-null, 3-letter unique country identifier. |
| country | Standardized country or region name. |
| year | Numerical year format (range: 1960–present). |
| population | Non-negative numerical values representing total count. |

4. Non-Functional Requirements
Reliability: The connection logic must include try-except blocks to handle common database errors (e.g., Authentication failure, Database not found).

Performance: The system should handle the bulk upload of 16,000+ rows in under 5 seconds on a standard local environment.

Security: Database credentials (username/password) should ideally be stored in environment variables or a .env file rather than hard-coded in the script.
